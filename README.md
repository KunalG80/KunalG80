## 🧊 About Me

I’m a **CDAC-certified software developer** with a background in **Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering** and hands-on experience in **backend development, automation, and system-level problem solving**.

At **DRDO**, I worked on real production systems — not toy projects — reducing downtime, improving accuracy, and automating infrastructure monitoring. I care about **clean logic, measurable impact, and systems that actually work**.

No hype. No fake “AI ninja” titles. Just solid engineering.
