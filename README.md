## 🧊 About Me

I’m a **CDAC-certified software developer** with a background in **Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering** and hands-on experience in **backend development, automation, and system-level problem solving**.

At **DRDO**, I worked on real production systems — not toy projects — reducing downtime, improving accuracy, and automating infrastructure monitoring. I care about **clean logic, measurable impact, and systems that actually work**.

I build **clean, reliable software systems** with a strong foundation in **data, backend development, and problem-solving**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **software engineering, data processing, and applied machine learning**.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

- Design and develop **backend systems & REST APIs**
- Work with **data processing, ML pipelines, and system automation**
- Debug **real-world systems** (software + hardware) under constraints
- Write **maintainable code**, not demo-only projects

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

- **Software Developer** roles (Backend / Full Stack)
- **Data Scientist / Data Engineer** roles (Entry to Mid-level)
- Teams that value **clarity, ownership, and engineering discipline**
  
If you care about:
- clean backend systems  
- automation that saves time  
- code that survives production
  
If your project involves **real systems, real data, and real impact**, we’ll get along.
